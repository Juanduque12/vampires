          My audio project is meant to show all the sounds my character hears
          throughout his day.
        </p>
        <p>
          My character is a vampire, so he hears very intensely. The heartbeat
          of others around him and his cat’s meows from the shadows as she
          watches over him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hardest part was deciding what sounds to put together. I solved
          this problem by closing my eyes and imagining myself in my characters
          day to day. I feel as if my sound is perfect and really paints the
          image I was going for.
        </p>
